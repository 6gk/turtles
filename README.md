 <p> ... and more! </p>

It's my gimmigk.  `:^)`

Fanart is in `OTHER/fanart`, files in lowercase top-level directories were (for the most part) by me (with a non-insignificant amount of help from google images)

Turtle is from google's old blob-era emoji, a still-updated version of which can be found here: https://github.com/C1710/blobmoji

Credit / license info is in the README of the relevant directories, if I made any mistakes and/or you want something you own removed, please let me know by emailing `gk` ​(​a​t) `comfi.es`
